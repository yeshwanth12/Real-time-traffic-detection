# Real Time Traffic Density Estimation
Frame by frame vehicle detection and estimation of density of traffic in real time done using OpenCV (2.4.7) in C++

Used Absolute differencing to detect the motion of the vehicles and Canny Edge detection algorithm to calculate the area covered by the vehicle

Results compared with Google Maps data and showed that the vehicle presence detection was more consistent than any map providing service relying on crowdsourcing due to the availability of actual traffic video footage
